This python program will calculate the frequency of letters in the English language.The program will parse a file to determine the relative frequency of each letter in typical English language usage:
     1. Prompt the user for the path to a file.
        1. Remember, trying to open a file in read mode when the file doesn't exist will cause your program to crash! Make sure you check whether the file exists.
        2. If the file doesn't exist, display an error message and quit the program.
     2. Read the file, line by line, and count how many times each letter occurs.
        1. Our files may get quite large, so we recommend not reading in the whole file at once.
        2. To determine whether a string contains only letters, you may want to use isdigit()'s cousin, isalpha().
        3. You may use any sort of structure you like to store the letter counts.
        4. We don't care about case -A should be counted in the same place as a.
        5. Helpful hint: if you want to convert between a letter (like A) and its ASCII value (A is 65 in ASCII) to use as an index into a list, check out the function ord(c), where c is a string with a single character.
     3. Calculate and display the relative frequency of each letter.
        1. The relative frequency of a letter is just how many times that letter appeared, divided the total number of letters counted.
        2. You don't need to control how many decimal places are shown, but letters should be displayed in alphabetical order (A-Z).
        3. For the purposes of this assignment, you should display capital letters (even though the counts are case-insensitive).
